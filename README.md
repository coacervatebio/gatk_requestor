# Coacervate

The goal of this project is to democratize the access to the tools and infrastructure required to perform genomic analysis.

Wants:
- to democratize access to the tools and infra required to perform genomic analysis
- operate in an open way that is not profit-driven
- collaborate instead of compete (competition can breed innovation though)
- by opening the tools and the datasets, you increase education
- a rising tide lifts all boats

Problem:
- volume of genomic data is outpacing the ability to analyse it (source)
- there are many good open source tools for analyzing, but they require specialized knowledge
- making these tools user-friendly is often done in a closed-source way
- lots of closed databases and the open ones are often not well integrated

Assumptions:
- access to bandwidth will increase dramatically faster than access to compute (source)
- consumer hardware is ill-equipped to analyze these datasets in an efficient manner
- cloud resources are great, but expensive
