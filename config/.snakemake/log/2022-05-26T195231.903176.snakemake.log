Error in rule index_cram:
    jobid: 0
    output: /datafiles/alignments/152.cram.crai
    shell:
        samtools index /datafiles/alignments/152.cram
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job index_cram since they might be corrupted:
/datafiles/alignments/152.cram.crai
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
